Location Map module (http://drupal.org/project/locationmap)

** Description:
The Location Map module displays a single geographic location for a website via Google Maps. It has following features:

* Creates a single Google Maps page (at http://yoursite.com/locationmap), designed to display one location for the site, with an address marker.
* The map location is automatically geocoded from a street address, if url_fopen is allowed on your server.
* Anyone with "Administer location map" permissions can drag the marker to further fine-tune its position if geocoding did not place the marker exactly where you wish it to be.
* Creates a block with a static image of the centre of the map, which links to the location map page on your site or a block showing an interactive map.

Location map module is simple by design and will remain that way. It creates only a single map for a site/block. It is not designed to attach locations to nodes, users, or other content. If you wish any of these more extensive features, see the GMap project (http://drupal.org/project/gmap) which is significantly more powerful and is designed to do all of these things.

(Location map is the successor of the Drupal 5.x-6.x module "gmaplocation". The name of the module was changed to reduce confusion with the submodule of the gmap project called gmap_location. On installing Location Map, map configuration data stored by any previous version of gmaplocation, as well as role permissions and any URL aliases to the map page are automatically updated.)
